  <h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;"> We celebrate Children’s day in India on 14th of November every year. India’s First Prime Minister Pundit Jawaharlal Nehru was born in Allahabad on 14th November 1889. Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru popularly known as Chacha Nehru was very fond of children. His love for Children was immense. He always advocated that the children of the country are entitled to a fulfilled childhood and higher education.</h3>
  <h1 style="color:white;text-align:center;">The History behind 14th November as the Children’s day</h1>
  <h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;">Because of Chacha Nehru’s immense love for children, 14th November was declared as Children’s day since the death of Nehru in 1964. Nationwide this day is celebrated to shower love and affection towards children. Schools and Colleges celebrate Children’s day with great enthusiasm. Teachers and students of every school on this day come out of their daily routine to celebrate the day.</h3>

    Children are the torchbearer of the future. Hence, every school celebrates this day with various events like quiz, debates, cultural programs like dance, music, and drama. Teachers organize and perform various cultural events for the students.

The way we bring them up will determine the future of the country.” Children’s day is a beautiful occasion to remember and celebrate the famous thoughts of Chacha Nehru. Celebration on children’s day is a great way to make both children and adults aware that children are the true future of the country. Hence everyone should understand the responsibility towards providing a fulfilled childhood to every child.The love and care that we give to our Children today, disregard of their social and economic status, will bloom as the fate of our country tomorrow.
